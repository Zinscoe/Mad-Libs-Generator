#First install flask which you'll use either 'pip' or 'pip3', pending which Python version you have
pip install flask

#Next we are creating a file called hello.py with the following code

#This import Flask
from flask import flask
#This instantiates Flask with the 'app' variable, using the __name__ attribute
app = Flask(__name__)

#This sets up a route / for your default page
@app.route("/")
#Next we create a function called hello
    def hello():
        #this returns the string 'Hello World!' to the user
        return "Hello World!"
#this will test to make sure the script is being ran
if __name__ == "__main__":
    #this runs the application from the 'app' variable so the user can visit the web application
    app.run()
