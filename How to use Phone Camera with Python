# So using a phone camera with Python is very useful. It allows you to create computer vision apps
# That will use a smartphone camera as a part of the application.

# Here's the process of using the phone camera with Python:
# First install the openCV library in python by typing:     pip install opencv-python
# Then download and install the IP Webcam application on your smartphone
# After installing the application, make sure your phone and PC are connected to the same network
# Then run the app on your phone and click Start Server
# After doing so, your camera will open with an IP address at the bottom. Copy the IP as you'll need it for
# the python code to open your phone's camera.

# Import the cv2 module
import cv2

# Then we import the NumPy library and set it as the 'np' variable
import numpy as np

# Set the 'url' variable as your IP address
url = "Your IP Address/video"

# This uses the VideoCapture method within the cv2 module with the 'url' variable as the parameter
cp = cv2.VideoCapture(url)

while(True):
    
    # This captures frame by frame
    camera, frame = cap.read()
    if frame is not None:
      # If frame isn't empty then it displays the resulting frame
      cv2.imshow("Frame", frame)
    q = cv2.waitKey(1)
    if q == ord("q"):
      break
      
# This function allows the user to destroy all windows at any time
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
