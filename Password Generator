#Start by importing the random module
import random

#Then we ask for the users input  for the length of the password
passwordlength = int(input("Enter the length of the password: "))

#Then we store the letters, numbers and special characters in the 's' variable
s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!@#$%^&*()?"

#Then we do a random sampling by joining the length of the password with the variable 's'
p = "".join(random.sample(s, passwordlength))

#Then we output the 'p' variable
print(p)
